# Fall 2020 Principles of Databases — Assignment 3

* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**  
* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**  

## ❖・Introduction・❖
Convert the MySQL `passwords` database from assignment 1 into a MongoDB database for this assignment. Because MongoDB doesn’t observe a conventional, relation-based database model, you’ll need to carefully analyze how best to translate MySQL to MongoDB.

**Note**: Because we’re not dealing with Node, or any other third-party scripting language to generate high-security cryptographic strings, store your passwords as plain text in your MongoDB database.

---

## ❖・Rules・❖
* Name your collection, `thePasswordsCollection`.
* Name the database, `passwords`.
* Export the database as BSON using the `mongodump` command. Ensure the database’s BSON file is saved to the `dump` folder.
* Export the database to the included `passwords.json` file as JSON using the `mongoexport` command.
* Don’t mix tabs with spaces; choose one or the other.
* If using spaces, indent by 2.
* Copy and translate all entries used to populate the original MySQL database.
* As in the first assignment, create MongoDB commands to do the following:
   + Create a new entry into the database, which already has your 10 initial entries |DONE
   + Get the password associated with the URL of one of your 10 entries |DONE
   + Get all the password-related data, including the password, associated with URLs that have `https` in one of your 10 entries |DONE
   + Change a URL associated with one of the passwords in your 10 entries |DONE
   + Change any entry’s password |DONE
   + Remove a password |DONE
